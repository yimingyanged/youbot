\section YouBotAPI

The basic idea of the youBot API is to represent a robot system as a combination of decoupled functional sub-systems. That is, this API represents manipulator arm and base platform as the combination of several joints. At the same time each joint is defined as a combination of a motor and a gearbox.

There are three main classes in the youBot API that a user should be aware of.

- YouBotManipulator class that represents youBot arm as the aggregation of several joints and a gripper
- YouBotBase class that represents youBot base platform
- YouBotJoint class that represents joints which make up both the manipulator and the base
