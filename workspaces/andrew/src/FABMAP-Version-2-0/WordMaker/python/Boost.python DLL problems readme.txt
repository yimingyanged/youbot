Getting boost python working


--There is an error 
  "DLL Load Failed"

-> Need to copy 
boost_python-vc80-mt-1_34.dll  into the path.

For debug builds, the equivalent DLL is 
boost_python-vc80-mt-gd-1_34.dll 


This is the DLL in

boost_1_34_0\bin.v2\libs\python\build\msvc-8.0\debug\threading-multi


---------------
Another caveat
---------------
Exception handling and RTTI are required to be enabled for Boost.Python to function properly. Secondly, under MSVC, you should build your project with the Multithread DLL versions of the C runtime library or you can get some very subtle and strange runtime errors.
